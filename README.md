# vin-order
//it's controller for order custom object

## Description
// TODO(user): An in-depth paragraph about your project and overview of use

## Getting Started
Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).
it should have cmdb configmap in namespace which you want to run this order operator.
you can use below way to create cmdb config map. 

1.
```shell
  kubectl create configmap cmdb --from-literal=db.host=localhost --from-literal=db.port=3306 \
  --from-literal=db.username=vin 
  --from-literal=db.password=vin 
  --from-literal=db.schema=cdr 
```
2.
```yaml
zouwei-macbook:samples zouw$ kubectl get cm cmdb -o yaml --context=docker-desktop
apiVersion: v1
data:
  db.host: localhost
  db.port: "3306"
  db.username: vin
  db.password: vin
  db.schema: cdr
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: cmdb
```

### Running on the cluster
1. Install Instances of Custom Resources:



```sh
kubectl apply -f config/samples/
```

2. Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:
	
```sh
CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -o manager
make docker-build docker-push IMG=blueskyxi3/vin-order:0.0.9
make deploy IMG=blueskyxi3/vin-order:0.0.9
date
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/vin-order:tag
```
	
3. Deploy the controller to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/vin-order:tag
make deploy IMG=blueskyxi3/vin-order:0.0.8

```

### Uninstall CRDs
To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

```sh
make uninstall
```

### Undeploy controller
UnDeploy the controller to the cluster:

```sh
make undeploy
```

## Contributing
// TODO(user): Add detailed information on how you would like others to contribute to this project

### How it works
This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/)

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/) 
which provides a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources untile the desired state is reached on the cluster 

### Test It Out
1. Install the CRDs into the cluster:

```sh
make install
```

2. Run your controller (this will run in the foreground, so switch to a new terminal if you want to leave it running):

```sh
make run
```

**NOTE:** You can also run this in one step by running: `make install run`

### Modifying the API definitions
If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```sh
make manifests
```

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets
